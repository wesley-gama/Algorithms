John and Mark are friends. They are 8 years old. John has 1.20m and Mark has 1.03m.
John grows 0.06m/year and Mark grows 0.9m/year. In which age Mark will be taller than John?

Algorithm:
- create 6 real variables: johnAge, markAge, johnHeight, markHeight, johnGrowth, markGrowth
- store the values in the corresponding variable
- create a while loop. What is the condition? johnHeight > markHeight
- what must happen inside the loop? increase John's and Mark's height and age.
- inside the while loop: sum John's height with John's growth
- inside the while loop: sum Mark's height with Mark's growth
- inside the while loop: sum the age with +1
- after the loop: print John's height
- print Mark's height
- print age
